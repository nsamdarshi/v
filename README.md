## ⚙️ Advanced Settings

### Real-time Mode (Date Locking)

By default, the site allows viewing all days immediately (so you can test it).
To make it "Real-time" (where days only unlock on their specific dates, e.g., Rose Day unlocks on Feb 7):

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Find the line:

   ```javascript
   let isDateLocked = false;
   ```

3. Change it to:

   ```javascript
   let isDateLocked = true;
   ```

4. Commit the changes. Now your partner can only open the days that have arrived!
