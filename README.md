   - `recipientName`: Your partner's name.

## ⚙️ Advanced Settings

### Configurable Year

In `config.js`, set the year for easy updating each Valentine's season:

```javascript
const config = {
    year: 2026,  // Change this each year!
    recipientName: "Your Partner's Name",
    // ...
};
```

### Real-time Mode (Date Locking)

By default, the site is set to **date-locked mode** where users can only see the day that matches the current date. Navigation arrows are hidden to prevent peeking ahead.

To switch to **testing mode** (view all days freely):

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Find the line:

   ```javascript
   let isDateLocked = true;
   ```

3. Change it to:

   ```javascript
   let isDateLocked = false;
   ```

4. Now you can navigate between all days for testing.

### Debug Panel (For Developers)

When the page loads, click the 🔧 icon in the top-left corner to open the Date Debug panel. This allows you to:

- Test any specific date (Feb 6-15)
- See the "Coming Soon" message (before Feb 7)
- Preview each day's content without waiting

## 💻 Running Locally (Optional)

If you want to edit on your computer:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Deon-07/ValentineWeek.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. To view changes, refresh the page.

---

## 📝 Recent Updates

- **WhatsApp Typing Effect**: Message now types in the input bar first, then sends to the bubble - just like real WhatsApp!
- **Date-Locked Navigation**: When `isDateLocked = true`, users can only see today's content (no navigation arrows).
- **Configurable Year**: Set `year` in config.js for easy yearly updates.
- **Debug Panel**: Press 🔧 to test any date without changing code.
- **International Date Support**: Uses browser's local timezone for accurate date detection.

## 🎵 Audio System

We've improved the audio system to ensure music plays reliably on all devices:

1. **Local Assets**: Music is now loaded from the `assets/` folder (`music.mp3`, `music_2.mp3`, etc.) instead of external links, ensuring it always works.
2. **Consent Modal**: If a browser blocks autoplay, a beautiful "Enable Music" popup appears, allowing the user to start the experience with one click.

## 🔧 Developer Tools (How to Change Date)

As a developer, you have two ways to change the date for testing:

### Method 1: The Debug Panel (Easiest)

1. Open the website.
2. Click the **Wrench Icon (🔧)** in the top-left corner.
3. Select any date (e.g., "Feb 8 - Propose Day") from the dropdown.
4. Click **Apply Date**.
5. The site will reload and behave *exactly* as if it were that day.

### Method 2: Manual Code Override

If you want to force a specific date via code:

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Find the variable `debugDate`.
3. Set it to the desired date string (e.g., `'2-14'` for Valentine's Day):

```javascript
// Set to null for automatic date detection
// Set to '2-7' through '2-14' to test specific days
let debugDate = '2-8'; 
```

### Method 3: Enabling/Disabling the Debug Icon

You can choose whether to show or hide the debug wrench icon 🔧 for the final user.

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Find the variable `showDebugPanel`.
3. Set it to `true` (show) or `false` (hide):

```javascript
let showDebugPanel = false; // Hide for production (Default)
// let showDebugPanel = true; // Show for development
```
